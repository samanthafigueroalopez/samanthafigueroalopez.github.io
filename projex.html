    Jose State University they have great ways to showcase our skills. The most famous ones are either robotic competitions or Hackathons they hold every summer. Since I am only a second year they are 
    some softwares and languages I am not fully familiary with. I have not done so many projects however, there are some I am 
    proud with especially with groupmates I worked with. During my Freshman year my group attending
    I worked on a companion robotic project. Our goal was for our little mini robot to locate sensors with 
    sensory motors that not only stop at the sensors but it causing it to crash into walls. 
    This was a great experience due to the fact that it tied with computer, mechanical, and electrical. 
    The video below is the robot when functioning. Since I have not a lot of group experience 
    when its comes to projects I have also done labs in C++ that have really improved my knowledge on coding.Moving on to more 
    electrical. In my Intro to Electrical Engineering class , one of my fvaorite projects was creating a radiowith the components that were given to us.

    In the photo below you can be able to view we connected the ciruit to an LC circuit. That LC circuit is connected to a wire to the ceiling 
    . From there we should able to get the frequency we want. Most of the Opamps were burnt due to the fact their was so little components.
